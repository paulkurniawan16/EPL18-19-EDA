# Welcome to My EDA for EPL Players (2018-2019)

In this repository, I conducted Exploration Data Analysis (EDA) of the data for the 2018-2019 English league football players. The goal to be achieved is to gain insight into the performance of players and their relationship to the variables that influence. The full dataset can be downloaded here: https://footystats.org/download-stats-csv#

# File Descriptions
There are only 1 file in this repository (except the README and the data requirements file). The notebook is a jupyter notebook which can be run on Google Colab. It contains step-by-step on how to EDA.
